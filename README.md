### Entity Relationships

#### One-to-Many Relationships

## üîß Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Provides comprehensive user account functionality including registration, authentication, and profile management for both guests and hosts. This feature serves as the foundation for the platform by enabling secure user identification and personalized experiences. Users can update their profiles, manage preferences, and maintain their account security through password management and profile verification.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings with detailed information including descriptions, pricing, amenities, and availability calendars. This feature forms the core marketplace functionality by allowing hosts to showcase their properties effectively with photos, location details, and house rules.

### Booking System
Facilitates the complete reservation process between guests and hosts with real-time availability checking, booking confirmation, and status management. This feature handles the critical transaction flow from property search to booking completion, including date validation, pricing calculations, and conflict prevention. 

### Payment Processing
Integrates secure payment gateway functionality to handle financial transactions, including booking payments, security deposits, and host payouts. This feature ensures reliable payment processing with support for multiple payment methods, automatic calculations, and secure fund distribution. The system includes comprehensive payment tracking, refund processing, transaction history, and automated invoicing for complete financial transparency.

## üîí API Security

### JWT/SSO Authentication
Implements JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication with Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities to ensure secure, stateless user sessions across the platform. This protects user accounts from unauthorized access and ensures that only authenticated users can perform sensitive operations like making bookings, processing payments, or managing property listings.

### Rate Limiting & Bot Protection
Deploys intelligent rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse from bots, scrapers, and malicious actors attempting to overwhelm the system or extract data illegally. This security measure protects against automated attacks, prevents API abuse, and ensures fair resource allocation among legitimate users. Rate limiting is particularly crucial for protecting booking endpoints from rapid-fire reservation attempts, search APIs from excessive scraping, and payment processing from fraudulent transaction floods.

### Virtual Firewall & DDoS Protection
Utilizes virtual firewall rules and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to safeguard the infrastructure from network-level attacks and traffic anomalies. This creates multiple layers of defense against malicious traffic patterns, IP-based attacks, and ensures service availability during peak usage or coordinated attack scenarios. The firewall prevents unauthorized network access while DDoS protection maintains platform stability and responsiveness for legitimate users during high-traffic periods.

### Principle of Least Privilege
Enforces strict role-based access control (RBAC) where users, API endpoints, and system components receive only the minimum permissions necessary for their specific functions. This security principle ensures that guests cannot access host-only management features, hosts cannot manipulate other users' properties or bookings, and system services operate with restricted database and resource permissions. This approach significantly minimizes the potential impact of security breaches, prevents privilege escalation attacks, and maintains clear separation of concerns across different user roles and system components.
